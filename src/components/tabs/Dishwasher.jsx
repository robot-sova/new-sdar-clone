          <p>With extensive experience handling all dishwasher problems, our technicians diagnose and repair quickly to keep your kitchen running efficiently. Here are some common dishwasher issues we address:</p><ul><p><strong>Dishwasher Not Draining</strong>: If water is left after a wash cycle, it's often due to a <strong>clogged drain</strong>, <strong>filter</strong>, or <strong>drain hose</strong>. We inspect these components, clean or replace them as needed, and ensure proper drainage.</p><p><strong>Dishes Not Getting Clean</strong>: When dishes are still dirty after a wash, it could mean <strong>clogged spray arms</strong>, a malfunctioning <strong>heating element</strong>, or a problem with the <strong>inlet valve</strong>. We troubleshoot and fix these issues so your dishes come out spotless.</p><p><strong>Leaking Dishwasher</strong>: Leaks can result from <strong>damaged door seals</strong>, <strong>cracked hoses</strong>, or <strong>loose water line connections</strong>. We pinpoint the source and make repairs to prevent future leaks that could damage your floors.</p><p><strong>Strange Noises</strong>: Grinding or squealing sounds often indicate <strong>motor issues</strong> or trapped <strong>food particles</strong> in the spray arms. Our technicians check for and fix any misaligned or worn components.</p><p><strong>Dishwasher Not Filling with Water</strong>: This issue can stem from a faulty <strong>float switch</strong>, <strong>inlet valve</strong>, or <strong>door latch</strong>. We assess and replace malfunctioning components to restore water flow and ensure a complete wash cycle.</p></ul>

          <p>Our factory-trained technicians can recognize when your dishwasher needs professional repair. Here's what to look out for:</p><ul><p><strong>Residue or Food Particles on Dishes</strong><br />If dishes aren't coming out clean, this may indicate low water pressure, a <strong>clogged filter</strong>, or <strong>spray arm</strong> issues. Scheduling a repair can restore your dishwasher's cleaning power.</p><p><strong>Water Pooling at the Bottom</strong><br />Water left at the end of the cycle points to drainage problems or a <strong>blocked drain hose</strong>. Unaddressed, this can lead to more significant repairs, so please call us early.</p><p><strong>Inconsistent Cleaning Cycles</strong><br />If your dishwasher stops mid-cycle or doesn't complete the wash, it could signal an issue with the <strong>control panel </strong>or <strong>motor</strong>. We can troubleshoot these problems to keep your dishwasher running smoothly.</p><p><strong>Unpleasant Odors</strong><br />Persistent smells often mean <strong>food particles</strong> are trapped in the filter or drain. Regular cleaning can help, but a professional inspection may be necessary if odors persist.</p></ul>

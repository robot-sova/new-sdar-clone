        <> <p>At <strong>Same Day Appliance Repair</strong>, we understand the challenges of maintaining <strong>commercial refrigeration equipment</strong>. Our technicians are well-versed in diagnosing and resolving common issues with <strong>commercial refrigerators</strong>, ensuring fast, reliable <strong>repairs</strong>.</p><h3>1. <strong>Refrigerator Not Cooling Properly</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />When a <strong>commercial refrigerator</strong> isn't cooling efficiently, we check for problems with the <strong>evaporator coils</strong>, <strong>compressor</strong>, or <strong>thermostat</strong>. We clean the evaporator coils to restore proper airflow if they are frozen or dirty. We also inspect and replace the <strong>compressor</strong> or <strong>thermostat</strong> to ensure your <strong>refrigerator</strong> maintains the correct temperature.</p><h3>2. <strong>Excessive Frost or Ice Build-Up</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />Faulty defrost systems, or damaged door gaskets can cause excessive frost inside your refrigeration equipment. Our technicians inspect the <strong>defrost heater</strong> and <strong>thermostat</strong> to ensure proper defrost cycles. We also replace damaged <strong>door gaskets</strong> to prevent warm air from entering, which causes frost build-up.</p><h3>3. <strong>Refrigerator Leaking Water</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br /><strong>Leaks</strong> in a <strong>commercial refrigerator</strong> are often due to clogged <strong>drain lines</strong> or a faulty <strong>water inlet valve</strong>. We clear <strong>drain lines</strong> to ensure proper water flow and check the <strong>water inlet valve</strong> for damage. If the valve is defective, we replace it to prevent further <strong>leaks</strong>.</p><h3>4. <strong>Refrigerator Making Loud Noises</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />Unusual noises can indicate problems with the <strong>fan motor</strong>, <strong>compressor</strong>, or <strong>evaporator fan</strong>. Our team identifies the noise source and replaces any failing components, ensuring your <strong>refrigerator</strong> operates quietly and efficiently.</p><h3>5. <strong>Refrigerator Door Not Sealing Properly</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />A faulty <strong>door gasket</strong> can cause temperature inconsistencies and increased energy costs. We inspect and replace damaged <strong>door gaskets</strong> to ensure a proper seal, which keeps cold air in and prevents costly <strong>repairs</strong> down the line.</p><h3>6. <strong>Refrigerator Has Power Issues</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />If your <strong>commercial refrigerator</strong> won't turn on or keeps shutting off, we start by checking the <strong>power supply</strong>, <strong>thermostat</strong>, and <strong>control board</strong>. We troubleshoot electrical issues and replace defective components to ensure consistent power and operation.</p><h3>7. <strong>Temperature Fluctuations</strong></h3><p><strong>How We Fix It:</strong><br />Inconsistent temperatures in <strong>commercial refrigerators</strong> can lead to food spoilage. We check the <strong>compressor</strong>, <strong>thermostat</strong>, and <strong>fan motor</strong> to ensure proper temperature regulation. We provide immediate repairs to restore consistent cooling if any component is faulty.</p></>

        <><p>From working closely with our clients, we know deciding between <strong>repairing or replacing a commercial refrigerator</strong> is a big decision for any business. Here's our rule of thumb: if <strong>repair costs exceed 50% of the price of a new unit</strong>, or if your fridge or freezer is over <strong>ten years old</strong>, a replacement might be the better investment.</p><p>Upgrading to a newer model often means fewer breakdowns, reduced repair needs, and improved <strong>energy efficiency</strong>â€”benefits that add up to significant savings in the long run. When we assess your unit, we'll take a close look at both the <strong>total repair costs</strong> and the overall condition of your appliance.

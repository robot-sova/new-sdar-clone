        <h3><strong>Unusual Smells or Smoke</strong></h3>
        <p>If you notice strange smells or smoke, it may be due to residue on the <strong>baking stones</strong>, <strong>aluminum foil</strong> buildup, or a fault in the <strong>broil burner</strong>. We clean components and remove <strong>other debris</strong> to ensure safe operation.</p> </>

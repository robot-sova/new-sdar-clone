        <><p><strong>Refrigerator Not Cooling Properly</strong><strong>How We Fix It:</strong> When a <strong>refrigerator isn't cooling</strong>, we inspect components like the <strong>compressor, evaporator coils,</strong> and <strong>thermostat</strong>. Often, cleaning the evaporator coils can restore airflow, but if deeper issues exist, we'll repair or replace the compressor or thermostat to ensure optimal cooling.</p><p><strong>Excessive Frost or Ice Build-Up</strong><strong>How We Fix It:</strong> Faulty defrost systems or damaged door seals can cause frost buildup. We inspect the <strong>defrost heater</strong> and thermostat for proper defrost cycles and replace any <strong>door gaskets</strong> if needed to prevent warm air infiltration.</p><p><strong>Water Leaks or Pooling</strong><strong>How We Fix It:</strong> Leaks are often due to <strong>clogged drain lines</strong> or a faulty water valve. We clear drain lines to restore proper water flow and replace the water inlet valve if it's defective to prevent further leaks.</p><p><strong>Strange Noises</strong><strong>How We Fix It:</strong> Unusual noises usually signal issues with the <strong>fan motor, compressor,</strong> or <strong>evaporator fan</strong>. We locate the source of the noise and replace failing components, ensuring quiet and efficient operation.</p><p><strong>Door Not Sealing Properly</strong><strong>How We Fix It:</strong> A faulty <strong>door gasket</strong> can lead to increased energy use and inconsistent temperatures. We inspect and replace damaged gaskets to create a tight seal and maintain efficiency.</p>
